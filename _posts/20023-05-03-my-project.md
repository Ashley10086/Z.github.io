This report explores and build a model to investigate the relationship between Credit score and other 20 covariates. Based on the model generated by step-wise regression, two additional covariates log(Amount) and sqrt(Age) were added to correct the skewness. Residual plot, QQ plot and Component-Plus-Residual Plot indicate this model is acceptable. Then modify the model by deleting any unusual and influential points in the data set to reduce the effect of outliers and high leverage points. Predicts made by the renewed model are close to the true value and 86% of the individuals can be correctly classified their risk class. The above evidence indicated this model is suitable in real world application .
